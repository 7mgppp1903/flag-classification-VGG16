# South American Flag Classification with VGG16 + XGBoost

![Model Visualization](https://github.com/7mgppp1903/flag-classification-vgg16/blob/main/Results/visualisation.png)

## Project Overview

This project performs **highly accurate image classification** of South American country flags using a **hybrid deep learning approach**. I utilize **VGG16 for feature extraction** and **XGBoost for classification**, achieving **97% test accuracy** on a custom dataset of over **10,000 flag images**.
